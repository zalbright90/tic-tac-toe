# Mylla: Norse-inspired Tic-Tac-Toe

Mylla is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with a Norse-inspired twist. Players use Norse runes instead of traditional X's and O's, adding a unique cultural flavor to the game.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay
- Norse runes (ᚷ and ᛝ) as game markers
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Custom Norse-inspired font
- Wooden board aesthetic

## How to Play
1. Go to [Mylla](https://zalbright90.github.io/tic-tac-toe)
2. Enter names for Player 1 and Player 2 (optional)
3. Click "Start Game" to begin
4. Players take turns clicking on the board to place their rune
5. The first player to get three of their runes in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
6. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a tie
